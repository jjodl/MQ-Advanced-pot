**What is a Proof of Technology?**

Proof of Technology sessions are complimentary classes to build
understanding of IBM technology and software with practical
presentations and hands-on lab exercises. 

**What is IBM MQ?**

You can use IBM MQ to enable applications to communicate at different times and in many diverse computing environments.

IBM MQ is messaging for applications. It sends messages across networks of diverse components. Your application connects to IBM MQ to send or receive a message. IBM MQ handles the different processors, operating systems, subsystems, and communication protocols it encounters in transferring the message. If a connection or a processor is temporarily unavailable, IBM MQ queues the message and forwards it when the connection is back online.
An application developer has a choice of programming interfaces, and programming languages to connect to IBM MQ.


## Lab section:

|  Topic                                | Description                                                                
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MQ Standalone Console](standalone-console)         | This section you will tap into the value of existing data flowing over MQ with zero impact to the existing applications or their messages, and without a need for re-architecture your message flows.
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MQ NativeHA (VM)](nativeha-rhel)         | This section you will tap into the value of existing data flowing over MQ with zero impact to the existing applications or their messages, and without a need for re-architecture your message flows.
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MQ NativeHA / CRR (VM)](nativeha-crr-rhel)         | This section you will tap into the value of existing data flowing over MQ with zero impact to the existing applications or their messages, and without a need for re-architecture your message flows.
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MQ OTEL (opentelemetry tracing)](opentelemetry-tracing)         | This section you will tap into the value of existing data flowing over MQ with zero impact to the existing applications or their messages, and without a need for re-architecture your message flows.
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MQ Streaming queues](StreamQ/README.md)         | This section you will tap into the value of existing data flowing over MQ with zero impact to the existing applications or their messages, and without a need for re-architecture your message flows.
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|       
| MQ Uniform Clusters        | **Being worked on** This section you will see how Uniform clusters enables applications to be workload balanced across loosely coupled queue managers  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| [MQ & Aspera FASP.IO Gateway](Faspio/index.md)       |  This section you will see the purpose of this lab to demonstrate the benefit of using Aspera fasp.io Gateway with IBM MQ over TCP.  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MQ Managed File Transfering (MFT) & Aspera FASP.IO Gateway      | **Being worked on** This section you will see in this lab to demonstrate the benefit of using Aspera fasp.io Gateway with IBM MQFTE over TCP.
